Contact Management System

Overview
This is a simple Contact Management System implemented in C++. The program allows users to manage a list of contacts, 
each consisting of a name and phone number. The user can perform the following actions:

-Add new contacts
-View all contacts
-Delete contacts by name
-Exit the system through a menu-driven interface.
This project demonstrates basic concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) in C++, including classes, vectors, and function-based input/output handling.

Features
-Add a Contact: The user can add a new contact by entering the name and phone number. The new contact will be stored in a vector.
-View All Contacts: The user can view all the contacts currently stored in the system.
-Delete a Contact: The user can delete a contact by specifying the contact's name.
